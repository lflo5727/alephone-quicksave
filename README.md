# Alephone Quick Saving
The Marathon plugin for people without endless time for video games.

The goal of this plugin is to give a simple keybind to quick save, so you don't need to wait to get to pattern buffers. Personally I just sometimes need to save & exit to tend to life. This just makes a call to `Game.save()`, you can just as easily type that in console, but I wanted a way to keybind it for playing on a controller.

## Installation
Either copy the `QuickSave` directory into the`Plugins` directory in the Alephone files or grab an archive from the Releases and place it there. [See the official docs here](https://github.com/Aleph-One-Marathon/alephone/wiki/Plugin-Guide).
